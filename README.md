# VoronoiLinker
Blender Addon for Node Editor which adds three new awesome features:


**Voronoi Linker**  
Increases the cursor's reach to a socket. No longer need to aim with your mouse to a small dot!  
Simplification of connection of nodes. Works in any node editor, including editors from other addons.  


**Voronoi Preview**  
Auto-create link-path from a socket to an outlet or an anchor.


**Voronoi Mixer**  
Wide possibilities of mixing different sockets in different editors using power VoronoiLinker!


**Fast Math**  
Bonus for "Voronoi Mixer" tool. Pie to quickly select the math operation and automatically connect sockets.


**Voronoi Hider**  
Bonus tool. Hide nearest socket to the cursor or unhide all sockets from the nearest node.


**Voronoi MassLinker**  
The same as an Voronoi Linker, only a lot at the same time.
